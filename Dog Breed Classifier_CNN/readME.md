# Convolutional Neural Network

The goal of this project is to create a dog breed identification application using convolutional neural networks. The resulting algorithm could be used as part of a mobile or web app. The code will accept any user-supplied image as input.  If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed.  If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling. 

The overall flow consists of the following steps:

* Import Datasets
* Detect a human
* Detect a dog
* Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
* Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
* Test the Algorithm
