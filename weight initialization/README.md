To see how different weights perform, we'll test on the same dataset and neural network. That way, we know that any changes in model behavior are due to the weights and not any changing data or model structure.To be specific, We'll train an MLP to classify images from the Fashion-MNIST database to demonstrate the effect of different initial weights. As a reminder, the FashionMNIST dataset contains images of clothing types; classes = ['T-shirt/top', 'Trouser', 'Pullover', 'Dress', 'Coat', 'Sandal', 'Shirt', 'Sneaker', 'Bag', 'Ankle boot']. The images are normalized so that their pixel values are in a range [0.0 - 1.0)
