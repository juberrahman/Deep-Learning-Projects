Unfortunately, I ended up with a loss value of 3.88 which is higher than our target loss. Then I increased the n_layers to 3, and hiddeh dimension size. I also played with learning rate and decreased it from initial value of 0.01 as I observed that the loss value is fluctuating to high and low after some epochs. Other than this I changed the sequence length multiple times starting from 10 and ending up with 25. Based on several iteration I found that a learning rate of 0.0001, n_layers=3, and batch size of 128 helped to bring down the loss value below 3.5. I tried to optimize further but due to GPU hours shortage I ended up with n_layers=2, and hidden_dim =256. (attached is the letter for GPU hours limitation)"
