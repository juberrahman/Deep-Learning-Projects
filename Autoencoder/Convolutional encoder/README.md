Sticking with the MNIST dataset, let's improve our autoencoder's performance using convolutional layers. We'll build a convolutional autoencoder to compress the MNIST dataset.

The encoder portion will be made of convolutional and pooling layers and the decoder will be made of transpose convolutional layers that learn to "upsample" a compressed representation.
