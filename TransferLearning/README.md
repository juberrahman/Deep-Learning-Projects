Here we'll be using VGGNet to classify images of flowers.VGGNet is great because it's simple and has great performance, coming in second in the ImageNet competition. The idea here is that we keep all the convolutional layers, but replace the final fully-connected layer with our own classifier. This way we can use VGGNet as a fixed feature extractor for our images then easily train a simple classifier on top of that.
